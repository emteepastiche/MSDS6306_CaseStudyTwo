Case Study 2 Codebook


Study Design:

We used two data sets, a training and a validation, with data concerning attrition at a specific company. We used R and Excel to determine which explanatory variables were most significant in determining whether or not a person will leave the company. We then used those variables to build a KNN model to predict Attrition. Our models had an 88.7% accuracy and a 95% confidence of (84.5%, 92.0%) accuracy.
