Case Study 2 Codebook


Study Design:

We used two data sets, a training and a validation, with data concerning attrition at a specific company. We used R and Excel to determine which explanatory variables were most significant in determining whether or not a person will leave the company. We then used those variables to build a KNN model to predict Attrition. Our models had an 88.7% accuracy and a 95% confidence of (84.5%, 92.0%) accuracy.


Objects:

dfTrain: testing data

dfVal: testing(validation data)

eda2: dfTrain with dummy columns

eda_test2: testing (validation) data with dummy columns

Extra_Test: adds explanatory variables

eda_test2: adds dummy variables to dfVal

Validation_Class: appends dfVal with dummy columns

Validation: Validation_Class with data_Yes

p: knn function on Training_Ind and Test_Ind

dfPreds: make predictions

cbind
